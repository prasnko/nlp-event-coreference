Saints could shut down Reggie Bush?
The Biloxi Sun Herald <MENTION CHAIN="12">suggests</MENTION> that Reggie Bush (knee) could be <MENTION CHAIN="1">shut</MENTION> down for the remainder of the Saints' season.
Beat writer Larry Holder puts this in a one liner, saying Bush ``could sit out the final two games.''
It may be speculative, or Holder has reasoning behind it that he doesn't give.
We'll know more about Bush Wednesday, when the Saints practice and hopefully reveal the results of his MRI.
