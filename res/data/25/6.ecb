The Saints have <MENTION CHAIN="1">placed</MENTION> Bush (knee) on injured reserve, the Baton Rouge Advocate <MENTION CHAIN="10">reports</MENTION>.
Bush <MENTION CHAIN="2">tweaked</MENTION> his left knee last Thursday and coach Sean Payton <MENTION CHAIN="5">said</MENTION> the Saints <MENTION CHAIN="8">decided</MENTION> to <MENTION CHAIN="1">put</MENTION> the running back on IR after determining that he would be unavailable for the team's final two games.
The positive here is that Bush's injury shouldn't impact his 2009 availability. 
Pierre Thomas figures to see the bulk of the Saints' carries the next couple of weeks, as a result.
