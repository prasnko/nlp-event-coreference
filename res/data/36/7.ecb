BC ATTORNEY GENERAL WALLY OPAL <MENTION CHAIN="5">ISSUED</MENTION> A STATEMENT TODAY SAYING THAT TWO MEN, WINSTON BLACKMORE AND JAMES OLER, HAD BEEN <MENTION CHAIN="1">ARRESTED</MENTION> ``ON CHARGES OF <MENTION CHAIN="3">POLYGAMY</MENTION> PURSUANT TO THE CRIMINAL CODE.''
OPAL SAYS THE <MENTION CHAIN="1">ARRESTS</MENTION> ARE THE PRODUCT OF A SEVEN-MONTH CHARGE ASSESSMENT <MENTION CHAIN="4">REVIEW</MENTION> BY SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TERRENCE ROBERTSON.
OPAL POINTS OUT THAT THIS PROSECUTION IS INDEPENDENT OF BOTH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BRANCH AND THE BC GOVERNMENT.
CRITICS HAVE SAID IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PURSUE POLYGAMY CHARGES AGAINST MEMBERS OF BOUNTIFUL FOR FEAR THAT CRIMINAL PROSECUTION COULD VIOLATE THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS.
