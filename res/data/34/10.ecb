I <MENTION CHAIN="3">confirmed</MENTION> yesterday that Obama has <MENTION CHAIN="1">offered</MENTION> the job and that Gupta had all but officially <MENTION CHAIN="5">accepted</MENTION>.
Got it up on the Web site at 2:36 p.m., mere moments after filing the story.
Cyberspeed comes in handy sometimes.
CNN, where I host a weekly program, didn't <MENTION CHAIN="3">report</MENTION> it until 3:59, but the blogs went crazy--lead story on HuffPost, top of Drudge's page, then the NYT and others.
Gupta wouldn't comment to me--while not denying the story--but <MENTION CHAIN="3">confirmed</MENTION> on his Twitter feed that he ``has been <MENTION CHAIN="1">approached</MENTION> by the Obama administration about the U.S. surgeon general's post.''
Everyone's digital these days.
It's interesting that Obama was so intent on <MENTION CHAIN="1">recruiting</MENTION> him that he met with the ``House Call'' host for 2 1/2 hours on Nov. 25.
He seems to want an administration of stars in the Hillary mode.
Gupta doesn't have a Panetta problem--he operates inside people's heads, after all--and has always been drawn to health policy, since a stint in the Clinton White House.
