Big Blue to Meet Its Match in HP-EDS
The repercussions from the <MENTION CHAIN="1">merger</MENTION> of Electronic Data Systems (EDS Quote - Cramer on EDS - Stock Picks) with Hewlett-Packard (HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks) will ripple broadly throughout the tech industry.
H-P <MENTION CHAIN="2">announced</MENTION> Tuesday that it will <MENTION CHAIN="1">buy</MENTION> the outsourcing services company for $13.9 billion.
The <MENTION CHAIN="1">deal</MENTION> will be bad ``for anyone that doesn't have H-P or IBM (IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks) on their business card,'' said IDC analyst Bob Welch.
Even IBM, the leader in the global services and outsourcing business, will ultimately feel the pressure. Gartner puts the worldwide market for IT services in 2007 at $748 billion.
With $54 billion in services revenue, IBM had 7.2% of the market. 
At $22 billion, EDS had 3%, while H-P had 2.3%.
And the <MENTION CHAIN="1">merger</MENTION> could throw a wrench into EDS's Agility Alliance, a group of vendors that regularly coordinate to supply hardware, networking, software and services to EDS's outsourcing clients.
The partnership has been very effective for EDS and its partners, Welch said.
