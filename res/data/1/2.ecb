A publicist says Tara Reid has <MENTION CHAIN="3">checked</MENTION> herself into rehab.
Jack Ketsoyan said Friday that the ``American Pie'' star went to the Promises Treatment Center.
He did not specify what she was being <MENTION CHAIN="8">treated</MENTION> for or when she <MENTION CHAIN="3">entered</MENTION> the facility.
``We appreciate your respect to her and her family's privacy at this time,'' he said in a statement.
Reid, 33, earned a reputation as a drunken partier after famously being photographed on a red carpet with her breast exposed, apparently unaware that the strap of her dress had fallen off.
Her film credits include ``Van Wilder'' and ``The Big Lebowski.''
She also hosted the short-lived, half-hour show ``Taradise'' on E!
