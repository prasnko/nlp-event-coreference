It's about time, right?
Perpetual mess Tara Reid has finally <MENTION CHAIN="10">decided</MENTION> to try and <MENTION CHAIN="13">shed</MENTION> her drunk-girl image and has <MENTION CHAIN="3">entered</MENTION> rehab.
``Tara Reid has checked herself into Promises Treatment Center,'' her rep told UsMagazine.com.
``We appreciate your respect to her and her family's privacy at this time.''
The actress, who hasn't done anything to speak of in years, has been seen, on so many occasions, wasted out of her mind, unwittingly flashing the paparazzi on the red carpet, looking scary-skinny, and making really D-list personal appearances.
Rehab has been calling her name loud and clear for years.
Best decision ever.
Good luck, Tara.
