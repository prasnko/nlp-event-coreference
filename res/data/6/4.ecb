Chris Weitz, who <MENTION CHAIN="5">directed</MENTION> ``The Golden Compass,'' is <MENTION CHAIN="1">negotiating</MENTION> to <MENTION CHAIN="2">direct</MENTION> the cinematic sequel to ``Twilight,'' industry sources <MENTION CHAIN="6">say</MENTION>.
While Summit Entertainment will not confirm Weitz is attached to the vampire series, The Hollywood Reporter said Friday he is the current candidate to direct ``New Moon.''
``Moon,'' like ``Twilight,'' is based on the four-book series written by Stephenie Meyer.
The movies follow a romance between a vampire and a mortal woman.
``Moon'' will be adapted for the big screen by Melissa Rosenberg with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Bell in the lead roles.
``Twilight'' director Catherine Hardwicke was unable to reach a deal to direct the sequel and her departure has been the topic of various rumors.
The Reporter said ``Moon,'' which is expected to have a larger budget than its cinematic predecessor, has been tentatively tabbed with a late 2009 or early 2010 release date.
