Scott Peterson has been <MENTION CHAIN="1">found</MENTION> guilty of first-degree <MENTION CHAIN="2">murder</MENTION>, a verdict that means he could be <MENTION CHAIN="3">executed</MENTION> if these same jurors <MENTION CHAIN="4">vote</MENTION> as the ``conscience of their community'' that he deserves to <MENTION CHAIN="3">die</MENTION> for his <MENTION CHAIN="2">crimes</MENTION>.
So Scott Peterson was <MENTION CHAIN="1">convicted</MENTION> because he's a liar and a cheat and a fink and because his famous lawyer was unable to come up with a plausible explanation for why Laci Peterson's body <MENTION CHAIN="5">washed</MENTION> up where it <MENTION CHAIN="5">washed</MENTION> up.
In fact, he was <MENTION CHAIN="1">convicted</MENTION> in part because defense attorney Mark Geragos <MENTION CHAIN="6">offered</MENTION> so many explanations for Peterson's <MENTION CHAIN="7">conduct</MENTION> and Laci's <MENTION CHAIN="8">disappearance</MENTION> that prosecutors were able to make jurors <MENTION CHAIN="9">laugh</MENTION> about the implausibility of them all.
In essence, the jury <MENTION CHAIN="1">concluded</MENTION> that the circumstances surrounding Laci Peterson's <MENTION CHAIN="8">disappearance</MENTION> and <MENTION CHAIN="2">death</MENTION> could not reasonably be explained in any other way but that Scott Peterson wanted her dead so he could continue and perhaps expand his secret life with Amber Frey.
Peterson was <MENTION CHAIN="1">found</MENTION> guilty because jurors believed he had a motive to <MENTION CHAIN="2">kill</MENTION> his wife and that Peterson's <MENTION CHAIN="7">conduct</MENTION> -- before, during and after Laci Peterson's <MENTION CHAIN="8">disappearance</MENTION> -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental.
