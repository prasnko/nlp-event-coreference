Hansbrough breaks 30-year-old UNC scoring mark
Forward Tyler Hansbrough <MENTION CHAIN="5">broke</MENTION> North Carolina's all-time scoring record in Thursday's <MENTION CHAIN="2">game</MENTION> against Evansville.
Phil Ford's school mark of 2,290 points <MENTION CHAIN="14">set</MENTION> in 1978 held strong amongst a plethora of talented Tar Heels over the years, but Hansbrough, who <MENTION CHAIN="10">came</MENTION> back for his senior season after being <MENTION CHAIN="11">crowned</MENTION> the National Player of the Year, <MENTION CHAIN="5">moved</MENTION> into the top spot with a tough <MENTION CHAIN="17">leaner</MENTION> in the lane with two Purple Aces defenders hanging on him with 7:42 left in the first half.
The game was stopped and Ford was on hand to congratulate Hansbrough at half-court.
The Missouri native suffered through a shin injury earlier in the season that forced him to miss four games.
In the five games he played before Thursday's action, Hansbrough averaged a team-high 22.8 points to go with 7.2 rebounds.
In 113 career games prior to Thursday, the forward has logged 20.2 points and 8.6 rebounds in just under 31 minutes an outing, while doing a lot of damage at the free throw line with nearly nine attempts per game.
Hansbrough, who has an outside shot at edging Duke great J.J. Redick for the all-time ACC scoring record (2,769 points), has succeeded in just about every statistical category, though he is still searching for the elusive fifth national title for the program, which moved to 10-0 after its 91-73 drubbing of Evansville.
Hansbrough finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds.
