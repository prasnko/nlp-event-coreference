Top-ranked North Carolina waited for Tyler Hansbrough to make history, then cruised to its latest lopsided victory.
Hansbrough <MENTION CHAIN="4">scored</MENTION> 20 points last night to <MENTION CHAIN="5">break</MENTION> the storied program's career scoring record and <MENTION CHAIN="6">help</MENTION> the Tar Heels (10-0) remain unbeaten with a 91-73 <MENTION CHAIN="2">victory</MENTION> over visiting Evansville (7-2).
The reigning National Player of the Year <MENTION CHAIN="3">passed</MENTION> Phil Ford for the record midway through the first half.
Ford, now an assistant coach to fellow Tar Heel alumnus Larry Brown with the NBA Charlotte Bobcats, finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points.
As soon as the record-setting shot went through the net, officials briefly stopped the game to allow Ford, coach Roy Williams and athletic director Dick Baddour to present Hansbrough with the game ball.
``I never dreamed I'd be here and be the all-time leading scorer,'' Hansbrough said as he stood alone at midcourt after the game.
``This is a great honor to be here and to represent you guys every night in this uniform.''
Shy Ely scored 23 points for the Purple Aces.
