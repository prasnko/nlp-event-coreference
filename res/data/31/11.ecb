The game was <MENTION CHAIN="16">stopped</MENTION> following the <MENTION CHAIN="17">basket</MENTION> to recognize the <MENTION CHAIN="5">achievement</MENTION>, and the <MENTION CHAIN="19">celebration</MENTION> continued after the <MENTION CHAIN="2">game</MENTION> when Hansbrough <MENTION CHAIN="20">addressed</MENTION> the crowd.
