26-year-old Matt Smith has been <MENTION CHAIN="4">cast</MENTION> as the next incarnation of the Doctor.

The guy is relatively unknown and the skeptics wondered if the right person was <MENTION CHAIN="4">chosen</MENTION>.
After all, everyone speculated that Paterson Joseph, who had appeared on a couple episodes of the show, was going to be the next Doctor and here we get some no-name.
