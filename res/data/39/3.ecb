Tennant has now been voted one of the most popular Doctors of all time and is <MENTION CHAIN="3">handing</MENTION> his sonic screwdriver over to actor Matt Smith.
Of course, there has been a media frenzy, with practically every national tabloid screaming ``Who??''.
But the <MENTION CHAIN="4">casting</MENTION> of Smith is a stroke of genius: he will not <MENTION CHAIN="5">bring</MENTION> any ``star personality'' with him that perhaps a ``name'' would have, but he seems utterly committed, and I have to say he does have an other-worldly look to him.
