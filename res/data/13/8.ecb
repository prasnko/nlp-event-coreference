Sarah Palin actually <MENTION CHAIN="2">apologized</MENTION> after the evangelical church she attends was nearly <MENTION CHAIN="1">destroyed</MENTION> by arsonists -- all because she still harbors guilt over her failed VP run.
Officials estimated the fire caused around $1 million in damage to the Wasilla Bible Church -- which Sarah hoped wasn't in connection to the ``undeserved negative attention'' from her failed campaign, according to the Sun Times News Group.
The police have no leads at this time -- and John McCain has not been named as a suspect.
